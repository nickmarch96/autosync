# autosync
AutoSYNC is a tool to ease file management. AutoSYNC is currently in version 1.0. AutoSYNC is partially inspired by git and MobaXTerm. AutoSYNC syncs files across networks and can automatically or manually send changes of a file to the remote host. AutoSYNC can not automatically detect changes of a remote file but will detect a change if it attempts to send data. This tool is meant for server  management tasks such as wanting to change configuration files with a gui on a guiless server. This tool can also be used as a rudementary backup system, however I would not reccomend this tool as a backup solution. There are many tools that do this and plugins for applications such as sublime. I have encountered issues with them working properly or just being clunky in design. I want to take the ease of use from git and apply it to easing the burden of remote server management.
